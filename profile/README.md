Grams is a revolutionary, open-source, decentralized platform built on blockchain technology, poised to transform the way we engage with the digital world. We are at the forefront of the Web3 revolution, providing an accessible, secure, and efficient platform for digital transactions and decentralized application (dApp) development.

## What is Grams?

At its core, Grams is about empowering YOU. We've developed a dynamic, user-centric ecosystem that puts you in full control of your digital assets. With the power of blockchain technology and innovative solutions like Grams Name Service (GNS), Subject Oriented Programming, and a suite of streamlined development tools, we're redefining what's possible in the world of decentralized applications.

### Key Features of Grams:

* **GNS - Grams Name Service**: Turn complex addresses into human-friendly names. GNS allows users and developers to map any name to any address, with support for subdomains and ENS.

* **dApps - Create Grams dApp**: With a simple command, `npx create-grams-dapp`, developers can scaffold a complete dApp based on Truffle, ready to be hosted on the Grams network.

* **Subjects - Subject Oriented Programming**: Revolutionize the way you build smart contracts. With Subjects, you can design contracts that integrate with our subject universe, allowing them to be triggered based on their subscriptions.
